## Notes

- As of now migrations always need to be ran and generated with the scripts defined in the `package.json`, just like `pnpm --filter api migrations:run` command. When working with something like better-auth, it is better to generate the entities and right after doing so, removing the migrations generated by the `@better-auth/cli`, while keeping the entities and generating the migrations using `pnpm --filter api migrations:generate`
